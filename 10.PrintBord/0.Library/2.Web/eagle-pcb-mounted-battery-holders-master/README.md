# eagle-pcb-mounted-battery-holders
Since Autodesk's library.io hasn't got the feature to publish my managed libary I share my library here. 

### How to use:
* Copy the library (with .lbr extension) to the where they are stored by Eagle. It is usually the following on Windows: C:\Users\<username>\Documents\EAGLE\libraries
* After this open the Library Manager. From the available tab select the desired library and click on the Use button
* Now you can add a module with the add tool...

### The list of battery holders:
